# AR Zoo and Museum Exhibits

Welcome to the **AR Zoo and Museum Exhibits** project! This prototype explores the use of Augmented Reality (AR) to raise awareness about endangered species — starting with the **La Plata dolphin (Pontoporia blainvillei)** and the **golden lion tamarin (Leontopithecus rosalia)** — through interactive experiences in mobile-style environments.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Educate the public about critically endangered Brazilian species.
- Create immersive and interactive AR experiences for zoo and museum exhibits.
- Promote conservation through engaging storytelling and bilingual content (Portuguese and English).
